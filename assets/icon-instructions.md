# Temporary Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder file. For the build to work properly, you need to add:

1. icon.ico - Windows icon file
2. icon.png - General icon file

You can use any square image (512x512px recommended) and convert it to .ico format using online tools like:
- https://icoconvert.com/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/

For now, the build will use Electron's default icon.
